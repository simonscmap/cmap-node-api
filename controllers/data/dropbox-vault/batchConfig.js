/**
 * Configuration Parameter Documentation:
 *
 * PARALLEL_BATCH_COUNT: How many batches run simultaneously in parallel
 * - Used by: stagedParallelExecutor (batch creation and execution)
 * - Impact: Higher = faster but more API pressure, may trigger rate limits
 *
 * BATCH_STAGGER: Delay between starting batches in parallel execution
 * - Used by: stagedParallelExecutor (batch timing)
 * - Impact: Prevents simultaneous API calls, reduces rate limit risk
 *
 * MAX_RETRIES: Number of retry attempts for failed operations
 * - Used by: retryHelpers (executeWithRetry function)
 * - Impact: Higher = more resilient but slower on persistent failures
 *
 * RETRY_BASE_DELAY: Base delay for exponential backoff calculation
 * - Used by: retryHelpers (calculateBackoffDelay function)
 * - Impact: Sets minimum wait time, affects total retry time
 *
 * RETRY_MAX_DELAY: Maximum delay cap for exponential backoff
 * - Used by: retryHelpers (calculateBackoffDelay function)
 * - Impact: Prevents extremely long waits, balances patience vs speed
 *
 * BATCH_TIMEOUT: Maximum time to wait for a single batch to complete
 * - Used by: stagedParallelExecutor (batch polling loops)
 * - Impact: Higher = more patient with slow operations, lower = fail faster
 *
 * POLL_INTERVAL: How frequently to check status of async batch operations
 * - Used by: stagedParallelExecutor (batch status polling)
 * - Impact: Lower = faster detection of completion, higher = less API overhead
 *
 * RATE_LIMIT_BACKOFF: Base delay when encountering 429 rate limit errors
 * - Used by: retryHelpers (handleRateLimitError function)
 * - Impact: How long to wait when rate limited, affects recovery time
 *
 * JITTER_MAX: Maximum random delay added to prevent synchronized operations
 * - Used by: retryHelpers, stagedParallelExecutor (timing randomization)
 * - Impact: Reduces thundering herd effects, spreads out API calls
 *
 * MAX_FAILURE_RATE: Acceptable failure rate for fault-tolerant operations
 * - Used by: stagedParallelExecutor (fault tolerance threshold)
 * - Impact: Operation succeeds if failure rate stays below this threshold
